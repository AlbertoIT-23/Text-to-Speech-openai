Honorable colleagues and fellow stakeholders, we stand at the intersection of technological progress and ethical responsibility. The emergence of AI grief technology—a form of artificial intelligence that simulates the personalities and behaviors of deceased individuals—represents both a remarkable innovation and a profound ethical challenge. Our objective today is not to impose rigid constraints on innovation but to explore how this new technology should operate within a framework of ethical standards, psychological safeguards, and robust privacy protections.
