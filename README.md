## üîß Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone this repository or download the files

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (Windows)
```bash
python -m venv tts-venv
.\tts-venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

This project was developed with Python 3.12.6. Install all required dependencies:

```bash
pip install openai==1.68.2 python-dotenv==1.0.1 python-docx==1.1.2 PyMuPDF==1.25.4 sounddevice==0.5.1 keyring==25.6.0
```

Or use the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Key Dependencies:
- **openai**: OpenAI API client for text-to-speech
- **python-dotenv**: For loading API keys from .env files
- **python-docx**: For reading .docx files
- **PyMuPDF**: For reading PDF files
- **sounddevice**: For audio preview functionality
- **keyring**: For secure API key storage (recommended)
- **tkinter**: For the GUI (included in Python standard library)

> **Note for Linux users**: You might need to install tkinter separately.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

### 1. Activate the virtual environment (if not already active)
```bash
.\tts-venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source tts-venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
```

### 2. Launch the GUI application
```bash
python universal-tts-gui.py
```

### 3. Configure your OpenAI API key
When launched for the first time, you'll need to configure your OpenAI API key:
- Click the "‚öôÔ∏è Config API Key" button
- Enter your API key
- Choose a storage method:
  - **System credential manager** (recommended for security)
  - **.env file** (convenient but less secure)
  - **Session only** (temporary use)

## üéõÔ∏è Using the GUI

### Text Input Options
- **Text Input tab**: Directly type or paste text
- **File Input tab**: Import content from TXT, DOCX, or PDF files

### Voice Configuration
- **Voice**: Choose from 11 different voices
  - Regular voices: alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer
  - Special voices (marked with *): ash, ballad, coral, sage, verse
- **Model**: Select the TTS model
  - **gpt-4o-mini-tts**: Most flexible, supports all voices and instructions
  - **tts-1**: Faster, supports limited voice set
  - **tts-1-hd**: Highest quality, supports limited voice set
- **Format**: Choose output audio format (mp3, opus, aac, flac, wav, pcm)
- **Speed**: Adjust speech speed (0.25x to 4.0x, works with tts-1 and tts-1-hd only)
- **Voice instructions**: Customize speaking style, tone, accent, etc.

### Output Options
- Select or create custom output folder
- Files are saved with descriptive names including voice and timestamp

### Controls
- **Preview Audio**: Test a short sample before generating the full file
- **Generate Audio File**: Process the entire text and save to disk

## üó£Ô∏è Voice Customization

The app supports OpenAI's voice customization through instructions. You can control:

- **Accent**: British, American, Australian, etc.
- **Emotion**: Happy, sad, excited, calm, etc.
- **Speaking style**: Narrative, conversational, formal, etc.
- **Pace and rhythm**: Speed variations, pauses, emphasis
- **Character impressions**: Specific personas or styles

Example instruction:
```
Speak clearly with a warm British accent, use a contemplative pace, and add subtle emotion when appropriate.
```

## üîÑ Alternative Script Options

If you prefer command-line usage or need automation options, two alternative scripts are included:

### 1. Universal Script (universal_tts.py)
A batch processing script that automatically converts all files in the `input/` folder:

```bash
python universal_tts.py
```

- Place files in the `input/` directory and they'll be processed automatically
- Creates an `output/` folder with the generated audio files
- Uses voice instructions from `instructions.txt` if available
- Great for batch processing multiple documents without GUI interaction
- Preserves original filenames with added voice information

### 2. Simple Script (tts-generate.py)
A minimal script for quick generation of speech from text strings:

```bash
python tts-generate.py
```

- Edit the script directly to input your text and instructions
- Useful for quick tests, demonstrations, or simple prompts
- No file handling or GUI overhead
- Perfect for integration into other scripts or workflows
- Ideal for developers wanting to understand the basic API implementation

## üîÑ Open Source & Extensible
This project is fully open source and designed to be extended. Feel free to fork it, improve it, or use it as a foundation for your own TTS applications. Pull requests welcome!
Some ideas for extensions:

- Add batch processing capabilities
- Add option to delete/remove stored API keys
- Create language detection and automatic voice selection
- Implement text chunking for longer documents
- Add a progress indicator for long audio generation
- Build a web-based version
